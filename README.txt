learningtimecheck module
================

==Introduction==
This is a Moodle plugin for Moodle > 3.9 that allows a teacher to create a learningtimecheck for their students to work through.
The teacher can monitor all the student's progress, as they tick off each of the items in the list.

Items can be indented and marked as optional or turned into headings; a range of different colours can be used for the items.
Students are presented with a simple chart showing how far they have progressed through the required/optional items and can add their own, private, items to the list.
